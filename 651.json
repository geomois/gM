She is immediately followed by two others, and they proceed to dance around the astronomer, and vanish one at a time until but one is left. The astronomer, picking her up, thinking he could keep her, hugs her tightly in his arms, but she also vanishes. Tired and heart-broken the astronomer grasps a broom and attempts to strike the moon, when she suddenly vanishes and in the distance laughs at him, rolling his eyes forward and backward, apparently convulsed with laughter. The moon suddenly changes to a crescent, and a fairy appears sitting on it. The veiled figure which stands before him throws back its veil and becomes animated; he rushes forward and grasps it, when, to his utter amazement, it disappears in the air. The Fairy Queen appears in the crescent. She first seats herself, and the astronomer puts his arms out for her, thinking perhaps he can reach her, when she disappears and in her place there stands a marble statue of a man. The astronomer, in his efforts to reach her falls to the ground. Rising and seeing the statue he is so incensed that he grabs a club, and as he is about to crush the statue it suddenly becomes alive. The large moon again appearing to his view he throws himself into it, and the moon, winking one eye, proceeds to chew him up. The moon's large teeth are seen to sink into the astronomer again and again until he is reduced to small pieces, when piece by piece he is ejected from the moon's mouth and lies there, one piled on the other. Suddenly in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears, but the Fairy Queen drives him off again. She proceeds to pick up different parts of the astronomer and hurls them across the room, and piece by piece they take their proper position in the chair, until the astronomer is again seated as he was before. Suddenly he comes to life again. He moves forward to grasp the Fairy Queen, when suddenly she disappears. The scene is again laid in the astronomer's observatory, the astronomer sitting at the table, asleep over his volume, which he has been studying.\"", "An astronomer falls asleep and has a strange dream involving a fairy queen and the Moon."], "votes": 1693, "producer": ["Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s"], "title": "La lune \u00e0 un m\u00e8tre", "plot outline": "An astronomer falls asleep and has a strange dream involving a fairy queen and the Moon.", "kind": "movie", "cast": ["Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s"], "production companies": ["Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s", "Star-Film"], "certificates": ["Spain:T"], "countries": ["France"], "country codes": ["fr"], "cover url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRhMWE1ZDAtZjViMS00Nzg4LWI2YTQtYjJjZWEyZmIxM2EyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTYxNjkxOQ@@._V1._SX100_SY140_.jpg"}

After causing much excitement our poor unfortunate Silas is hustled out in the street, but we are not informed whether he gets his money back or not.

Then the musketeer breaks the hoop, takes out of his hat a lot of flowers, which he throws on the pieces of the hoop, and by his act he makes a lovely wreath, from which appears a beautiful woman. This woman is then substituted by an immense and grinning face, into which the clown jumps. Then an explosion is heard and nothing is left of the clown nor the head.

It was taken amid scenery of the wildest natural beauty and enacted with the greatest possible fidelity to the original. The costumes, arms, log cabins, etc., are all historically correct. The story embodies the adventures of the greatest of all the American scouts and pathfinders, \"Kit Carson,\" his life in the wilderness, his hand-to-hand conflicts with the savage Indians, his hairbreadth escapes and his safe return to his log cabin home in the clearing. The subject is absolutely a novelty in moving pictures. 1. MORNING IN THE WILDERNESS. As the dawn breaks, Kit Carson and his fellow trapper are seen awakening from their pine bough couches. They wash at the brook, start a fire and prepare their frugal meal. This finished, they remove all trace of the fire, arrange their packs, take their rifles and start off into the depths of the forest. 2. INDIANS FIND THE TRAIL. The same scene. The trappers have departed and a band of painted Indians appear. They discover the trail of the trappers, and after a brief conference start out after them. 3 IN CAMP FOR THE NIGHT. Here we seee Kit Carson and his companion, fatigued by the weary tramp of the day, locating their camp by the side of another stream. The evening meal is cooked and the trappers lie down to sleep. 4. THE NIGHT ATTACK. While Kit and his companion are asleep, the Indians make their treacherous attack. The fight is short and bloody. Three of the savages are laid low, but Kit's companion is killed and Kit himself after a terrific struggle, is taken captive and bound. 5. OVER THE LOG. Here we see the exultant savages and their captive threading their way through the dense growth of the forest. They come to a stream which is spanned by a large birch log. Over this the Indians pass in single file, followed by Kit, his arms bound but all senses alert. One buck brings up the rear. As Kit reaches the center of the log, he engages the attention of the buck for an instant, then quick as a flash topples him into the water, and springing into the water on the opposite side, Kit is lost to view. The other Indians come running back and plunge through the water in their eager search for Kit. 6. THE CANOE CHASE. A wild river. On either side immense pine trees. Around a distant turn Kit is seen coming in his canoe, paddling for dear life. He is followed by three other canoes, filled with Indians, all paddling desperately. Kit fires at the foremost canoe and all disappear around another bend of the river. 7. ARRIVAL OF THE INDIAN SCOUT. Farther down the river an Indian scout is seen rapidly approaching in his canoe. He runs his frail craft ashore and tells his companions of the coming of Kit. 8. ATTACK ON CANOE AND SECOND CAPTURE OF KIT. The Indians who have been warned in the preceding scene hide in ambush. Kit comes along in his canoe unconscious of this new danger. As he comes opposite the ambush, the savages, naked save for their breech-clothes, jump into the water, overturn the canoe, and after another thrilling conflict the intrepid Kit is again a prisoner. 9. IN THE INDIAN CAMP. This is a remarkable scene. Here we have the Indian village, with its skin-covered tepees. Squaws and their papooses, young bucks and Indian maidens are seen at their various occupations. Here we have real Indian life. Kit is brought into camp by his captors and his advent creates great excitement. He is tied to a tree and subjected to various tortures and indignities, which he bears with undaunted mein. Even when tomahawks are hurled at his head he does not falter. Night comes, and the life of the village is stilted. Kit is guarded by one brave, who sleeps on his rifle by the fire. Death seems very near, but help is near at hand. An Indian maiden, moved to compassion by his condition, severs his bonds and once again Kit is free. 10. THE HOME IN THE WILDERNESS. Here we see Kit's rude log cabin in the clearing. His wife and children are busy with household affairs and eagerly watching for the return of the father. A little girl runs in with the glad news, and soon Kit stalks in and is quickly overwhelmed by the loving embraces of his wife and children.", "Kit Carson is captured by Indians and tied to a tree in the Indian village.

He is known to be the most expert, as well as the bravest, of all fire fighters.

Here we see in the midst of a primeval forest, a little clearing and the rude log-house erected by the sturdy frontiersman. A little girl leaves the cabin, and tripping daintily along the forest path in her bare feet, goes to a neighboring spring for water. What she sees lurking in the shadowy thickets causes her to fly back to the cabin for her life. She has no sooner passed the threshold, slamming the door behind her, when a half dozen painted Indians burst into view in close pursuit. Immediately the long rifle-barrel of the pioneer protrudes from a loophole in the cabin wall. It speaks, and a savage leaps into the air and falls clutching the sod. The other Indians slink back, only to reappear an instant later crawling through the grass like snakes and pushing bundles of dry limbs and grass before them. The settler's rifle speaks again and again, but the savages succeed in pushing the combustible material against the house, and in an instant it is fiercely blazing. AN INDIAN MASSACRE [BURNING OF THE CABIN AND MURDER OF THE SETTLERS]. A little girl runs in with the alarm. The door is quickly locked and barred and the long rifle appears at the loop-hole and is frequently fired. The Indians gradually close in on the ill-fated home, and finally have it ablaze from a fire of brushwood. The Indians, now in a frenzy over the success of their fiendish enterprise, procure a log and using it as a battering ram they hurl themselves upon the door and batter it in. The pioneer rushes out to defend his loved ones, but he is quickly overcome and tomahawked, and his wife as quickly meets the same fate. The little girl, terror-stricken by the awful scenes she has witnessed, is seized by the savages and carried off a prisoner. THE OATH! [DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES] In the next scene all that is left of the cabin is a smoldering ruin. A company of trappers come rapidly out of the forest and discover the bodies of the unfortunate man and woman. With bared heads, and in most impressive fashion they register an oath never to rest until they have wreaked vengeance on the Indian murderers and rescued the child. THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL [CROSSING THE MOUNTAIN]. A magnificent scene showing the savages leading their captive along a winding path on the mountain-side. The little girl sagaciously leaves a trail by tearing a bit from her dress. The trappers following shortly after discover the clue and press on in pursuit, encouraged by the knowledge that the girl is probably still living. VENGEANCE [RESCUE OF THE CHILD FROM THE INDIANS]. The Indians come to their evening camp by the side of a forest stream. After a drink of clear water, they tie the little girl to a tree and prepare for their night's rest. The trappers are close upon them however, and with a wild yell the white men hurl themselves upon the Indians. A terrific hand-to-hand combat ensues, and the Indians are slain remorselessly. The little girl is quickly released from her bonds and, as the picture ends, she is in the arms of one of the brave trappers who have rescued her.

Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to stop the approaching train. They make him write an order to the engineer to take water at this station instead of at the regular watering stop. The train stops, the conductor comes to the office window, where the operator delivers the order while the bandits keep their revolvers trained on him. No sooner has the conductor left when they bind and gag the operator, and hastily depart to catch the moving train. This scene shows the train at the water tank. The bandits are hiding behind the tank, and just before the train pulls out they quickly board the express car wherein the messenger is busily engaged with his duties. Alarmed by the unusual sound, the messenger unlocks the door, peeps through the keyhole, discovers the bandits and quickly locks the iron boxes which contain the valuables. He then throws the key through small window and pulls out his revolver to defend the valuables entrusted to him. Two robbers succeed in entering the car. The messenger bravely attacks them and discharges his revolver, but he is quickly laid low by a bullet. The bandits bind and gag him and then try to open the treasure box. When they find it locked they search the messenger for the key, and as they do not find it, they blow up the strong box with dynamite. They take the valuables and the mail bags and quickly leave the car. During all this time the train is seen flying past beautiful scenery. While two of the robbers blow up the strong box in the express car, two other ones hold the engineer and the fireman at pistols' point. The fireman takes a coal shovel and climbs up on the tender to defend himself and his position, but he soon finds himself overpowered and thrown from the swiftly moving train. The two bandits then compel the engineer to stop the train. Forced by the robbers, the engineer brings the train to a stop, uncouples the engine and pulls ahead about two hundred feet, always covered by the bandits' pistols. In the meantime two of the bandits compel the passengers to leave the coaches with hands up. They line them up along the tracks, go through their pockets and relieve them of all their valuables. One passenger makes an attempt to escape, but is instantly shot down by one of the bandits. As soon as they have all the booty the bandits mount the engine and make good their escape, while the passengers lend their helping hand to their unfortunate friend who is badly wounded by one of the bandits. The bandits bring all the booty on the locomotive and command the engineer to pull the lever and pretty soon we see them disappear in the distance. Far out in the rough countries the bandits command the engineer to stop, descend from the engine, and escape to the mountains with the stolen goods. This scene shows the bandits coming down from the mountains into the valley, where they cross a stream to get to a place of safety. The scenery is truly beautiful. One of the robbers, in his hurry, slips and falls in the water, but he quickly rises and makes good his escape. This scene brings us back to the interior of the telegraph office, where the operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After a desperate struggle he succeeds in reaching the table where his instruments stand. He telegraphs for help and manipulates the key with his mouth, and then falls to the floor, fainting from exhaustion. The operator's little daughter enters to bring him his daily dinner. She finds her father bound, kneels down, praying to the Lord to give her strength to help her poor father, throws a glass of water in his face, restoring him to consciousness, takes a knife and cuts the ropes and removes the gag from his mouth. This typical Western dance hall shows some men in company with women. A tenderfoot appears upon the scene and is made to dance in the regular Western style. Suddenly the door opens, the operator's little daughter enters and relates what has happened. The men quickly stop their merriment, take their guns and leave in pursuit of the outlaws. The bandits are seen dashing through the woods on spirited horses followed closely by the Sheriff and a large posse. One of the bandits is shot and falls from his horse, but he staggers to his feet again and kills one of the Deputy Sheriffs before he expires. This scene shows the bandits in a fierce fight with the Sheriff's posse. The bandits dismount their horses, and, not thinking that the Sheriff and his Deputy were so near, are just beginning to look over their booty when suddenly the Sheriff and his Deputies appear on the scene. A desperate battle takes place, and, after a brave stand the bandits and several of the pursuers breathe their last. This scene shows a life-size picture of Daniels, the chief of the bandits, as he takes aim and fires into the audience. The picture is so realistic that women scream, and even though no sound is heard, they put their fingers in their ears to shut out the noise of the firing."], "genres": ["Short", "Western"], "distributors": ["S.

The course of true love seems to run smoothly, and we are next introduced to the lady's home, where the young man is paying a visit and is introduced by the girl to her, father and mother, typical old darkies of before the war time, and several funny scenes follow in which the kid hint her plays a prominent part. The coon favors his girl with many presents and lavishes attentions upon her, although it cannot he said that the courtship proceeds altogether without incident. A rival appears on the scene, razors are drawn and finally a duel is arranged, at which both suitors, accompanied by their seconds, appear on the field of honor and exchange shots at thirty paces; one of the combatants is carried off the field, while our original hero remains the master of the situation, and the girl, arriving at the moment, is so pleased with his valor that arrangements for the wedding are made at once. The happy climax is reached at last and the marriage ceremony makes the two coons one and ends the \"wooing\" in a wedding.

His gambling experience has been unsuccessful and he loses not only his money but his clothes as well, and finally is compelled to rob a scarecrow in order to get clothes enough to get home again at all, which he finally gains in a very disheveled and ragged condition. The unfortunate coon has not been home long before he is attacked by imaginary foes as the result of his drinking bout; seizing a broom he gives battle wildly but is surprised by his wife, who, disgusted with the condition in which her husband has returned, attacks him viciously and gives him the beating he so richly deserves and ends by throwing a tub of suds and dirty water all over him."], "kind": "movie", "producer": ["William Nicholas Selig"], "title": "The Wooing and Wedding of a Coon", "plot outline": "The opening shows a colored nursemaid in the park with baby carriage, and seated on a bench receives...", "aspect ratio": "1.33 : 1", "countries": ["USA"], "country codes": ["us"], "genres": ["Comedy", "Short"]}

The lovers now go into the country to live in an unpretending villa, where they are enjoying their happiness as a young married couple. Armand's money does not suffice, and quite secretly Marguerite sells her horses, carriage and jewelry. One day Prudence comes out to Marguerite to help her to dispose of some of the jewelry, and now Armand learns how matters stand. At once he starts off for Paris in order to procure money. During his absence his father arrives and tries to induce Marguerite to give up Armand. He succeeds, and for the sake of Armand's future she promises to go away, and only to leave a letter, in which she says: \"All must be over, but whatever happens do not condemn me too hard.\" One year later the two meet again in a gambling house. Very much excited, Armand starts gambling with Marguerite's new lover and wins from him again and again. When all the gamblers have left the hall, Marguerite remains, calls Armand and tries to explain the matter to him, but he gets into a perfect rage, throws her down on the floor and in front of all the people he flings her a heap of money in the face. Only once more the lovers meet again, at Marguerite's deathbed. Her only comfort is that Armand's father regrets his hard-heartedness and gives Armand permission to go back to her.

The promulgation of this fact draws to his office a most startling variety of monstrosities, all anxious to submit to his esoteric powers, whereby they hope to become Utopian as to face and figure. In his suite are a number of cabinets, in which the mere confining of the patient works wonders, transforming unsightly Calibans into beautiful Houris. The first to enter his chambre mysterieux is a tiny mite of femininity. The young lady is less than three feet tall, but under the professor's wonderful treatment she grows rapidly, and while she has now attained a condition of extreme pulchritude, she is placed in a most embarrassing position from the fact that as she grows tall and stately her gowns have remained le meme, reaching only to the knees. Oh, mercy! As an absolute antithesis of his first patient there appears a young girl who, though fair of face, must have been a lineal descendant from Teutobochus, the ancient giant king. She is at least eight feet tall and surely a \"line of sweetness long drawn out.\" Placing her under a pile-driver, the hammer of which balances 3,000 pounds, the professor hypnotizes her and starts the machine. Blow upon blow is rained on her shapely head until at last she emerges, a Naiad of symmetrical loveliness. Then comes a lady sporting a pair of pedal extremities that would surely cause Chicago to look to her laurels. These are quickly reduced from their amplitudinous dimensions to the possibility of a \"Louis Quinze.\" The proboscis next requires the professor's attention, a handsomely dressed society lady appearing with a marcel wave on her nose. But watch the professor! While he is engaged with this patient the Gargantuan form of a woman comes waddling in. She looks like a balloon and moves along with the grace of the car of Juggernaut. She echoes Hamlet's plea, \"O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew!\" But Doc Skinum's the boy who knows what to do, and placing her on a stretcher, with a block and fall he lifts her onto the reducing table. He then turns on the current and through the pellucid vapor that arises we see the rapidly evanescent form of Elephantine Lizzie. The doctor having been called away by the lady with the distorted olfactory organ, whose footman had gotten into one of the cabinets and instantly changed to a policeman, forgets to turn off the fluid, and around goes the pointer on the indicator like the hand of a clepsydra, until, on his return, he finds poor Lizzie reduced to an infinitesimal modicum of her former self. In fact, she is about the size of a new-born infant. Here would be trouble for anyone but Skinum. So hurriedly placing her in the cabinet of beauty, she is transformed into a most charming duenna. These and many others are the amazing changes and cures performed by the old professor in the course of the film, which, as a whole, will prove a most effective cure for \"blues\" in the spectator whose good fortune it will be to view it, for it is unquestionably an assured laughing hit."], "kind": "movie", "title": "Dr. Skinum", "plot outline": "Dr. Skinum, the learned professor of physiology, dermatology, biology and all the other \"ologies,\" boldly claims to correct any error of nature...", "aspect ratio": "1.33 : 1", "languages": ["English"], "cast": ["Robert Harron", "Anthony O'Sullivan"], "countries": ["USA"], "country codes": ["us"], "language codes": ["en"]}

He at once sets to work with all his energy. From a wandering chemist he buys an opiate, his friend takes it and succeeds in putting it into a bottle of wine intended for the caliph's harem guard. When the two eunuchs are sleeping soundly on their guard, the daring young man sneaks into the harem to see if he has understood the black eyes right. His appearance creates great consternation among the ladles of the harem. He has just made sure that he did understand the language of the black eyes as the caliph appears, and for this time puts an end to his impudence. The two sleeping eunuchs are imprisoned, and the new guard is cautioned to keep a sharp lookout. The lovesick young man keeps his aim in view. That which cannot be gained in one way, must be obtained in another. He buys a basket and some clothes from an old woman, and disguised as a basket woman he easily gains admittance to the harem. This time he is more successful. Sulejma sends the slaves away, gets into the basket and permits the courageous young man to carry her away. At the city gateway the fugitives are overtaken. The pursuers are close by, and Sulejma cannot run as quickly as necessary. A Turk is just passing by with two horses: quick as lightning Mr. Hopkins pounces upon him, throws him to the ground and jumps into his saddle. Jackson helps Sulejma on the other horse and off they go. Jackson stays back, prepared to sacrifice his own life, rather than let the caliph outside the city wall. He shoots the caliph and then sinks down, shot by one of his pursuers' bullets. His and the caliph's death have saved Mr. Hopkins' life and that of his sweetheart.

Armand at once falls in love with her, and as Marguerite is taken ill during the dancing, he is the only one who is taking care of her. In the second act the two have grown more familiar, although Marguerite has not quite given up her old acquaintances. One day, for instance, Armand has to leave her for the sake of a count, who has invited her for a drive. From the street Armand has watched the count's visit, and in a fit of passionate jealousy, he writes a letter to Marguerite, saying: \"I have seen the count enter your place. You must choose between him and me.\" Marguerite's friend gives her the letter. One minute later the agreement is made, and the count drives off alone. The lovers now go into the country to live in an unpretending villa, where they are enjoying their happiness as a young married couple. Armand's money does not suffice, and quite secretly Marguerite sells her horses, carriage and jewelry. One day Prudence comes out to Marguerite to help her to dispose of some of the jewelry, and now Armand learns how matters stand. At once he starts off for Paris in order to procure money. During his absence his father arrives and tries to induce Marguerite to give up Armand. He succeeds, and for the sake of Armand's future she promises to go away, and only to leave a letter, in which she says: \"All must be over, but whatever happens do not condemn me too hard.\" One year later the two meet again in a gambling house. Very much excited, Armand starts gambling with Marguerite's new lover and wins from him again and again. When all the gamblers have left the hall, Marguerite remains, calls Armand and tries to explain the matter to him, but he gets into a perfect rage, throws her down on the floor and in front of all the people he flings her a heap of money in the face. Only once more the lovers meet again, at Marguerite's deathbed. Her only comfort is that Armand's father regrets his hard-heartedness and gives Armand permission to go back to her.

He is paying special attention to Kitty, and as she is unable to conceal the passionate love she is bearing towards the Baron, it is not surprising that the Baron, one evening as he is fetching the two sisters from the music-hall in his motor-car, asks Kitty to marry him. Neither the sad circumstances in Kitty's home nor the obstacles which his family and friends of rank try to throw into his way, in order to make him give up this marriage, can induce him to desist from his purpose.

The idyll is interrupted by a servant, who is bringing instructions for the Baron to go to the colonial forces in Africa. With anxious forebodings for the future, man and wife part, he to face a precarious destiny, and she to spend many a sad and lonely day with her haughty mother-in-law.

He is persistent in his suit for her hand, but outside of a seemingly cordial friendship the lady apparently does not return his affections. There is a reason for this. Osman Bey, a Turkish nobleman, desires the hand of this charming girl. He has expressed his love for her to her father, who is an ambitious, worldly man and who aspires to obtain that social recognition which is so dear to the average man of wealth. Mons. Dupont is well aware that he is selling his daughter, and so cleverly does he arrange matters by pretending that he is facing financial ruin, that he persuades Flora into giving her consent to the marriage in order to save his credit. Several months later, whilst sightseeing in Constantinople, Jack by accident meets Flora, who is driving in a closed vehicle. He is startled at the change in her appearance and indignant over the revelation of her misery and ill-treatment. Almost a prisoner in the house of Osman Bey, she is denied friends and relatives. Her one great desire now is to get away from her tyrannical and brutal husband. Jack determines to aid her, and tells her that he will gain admittance to the grounds of the palace after sundown, where he may talk with her and if possible formulate a plan whereby she may gain her freedom. True to his word Jack is on hand at the appointed time, but is unable to pass the guards at the gate. Nothing daunted, this daring American determines to scale the massive walls, which he does after a great deal of difficulty. Making his way through the beautiful gardens, he manages to see through a lighted window Flora's face and form, Gently tapping on the pane of glass her attention is attracted, but a female spy, ordered by Osman Bey to keep an eye on his wife, observes the signal from the window and immediately acquaints her master with the knowledge of his wife's indiscretion. Burning with rage, the infuriated husband summons his slaves and orders them to take the American prisoner. Jack has just greeted Flora, when he is startled by a sharp word of command, and turning suddenly he is seized by the stalwart slaves of the palace and dragged away. Flora appeals to her enraged husband for Jack's release, taking all the blame on herself, but to no avail. The prisoner is carried to an underground dungeon, where he is left to ponder over the perplexing situation in which he now finds himself. Maddened by grief, the poor girl determines in her desperation to go to the Sultan and beg his clemency. Escaping from her chamber window she makes her way to the Sultan's palace, and gaining admittance is granted an audience by his majesty. Struck by her beauty and fired by the crafty thought that he might gain this helpless woman for his harem, he promises her the pardon, but instead of letting her take it he dispatches one of his officers with the papers, at the same time commanding the bewildered Flora to remain at his palace. How Jack is led out to execution and how the pardon arrives just in time to save his life, much to the chagrin of Osman Bey, is all vividly shown. Jack has learned of Flora's detention in the Sultan's palace, and so embittered is he at this outrage that he joins the cause of the revolutionists. The last scenes of the picture show the attack on the Sultan's palace, and the meeting of Osman Bey and Jack in a hand to hand conflict in which the Turk is bested, which is followed by the rescue of Flora and the capture of the despised Sultan."], "kind": "movie", "producer": ["William Nicholas Selig"], "title": "In the Sultan's Power", "plot outline": "Jack Thornton, an American traveler, while touring Europe meets the daughter of an old French nobleman and falls in love with her...", "aspect ratio": "1.33 : 1", "languages": ["English"], "cast": ["Hobart Bosworth", "Betty Harte", "Tom Santschi", "Stella Adams", "Frank Montgomery", "E.

Caught in a terrible storm in the Pacific Ocean, the vessel is wrecked and all on board are supposed to have been drowned, at least so the newspapers chronicled. What a blow this was to the young wife, waiting for her dear one's return. Although the evidence was apparently conclusive, still she could not reconcile herself to the fact that her husband had gone from her forever; something in her heart tells that he still lives, and in truth, for we see the poor shipwrecked mariner cast up by the seething sea on to a desert island in the Western Ocean. Here he spent seven long, weary years, worse off that De Foe's famous hero, \"Robinson Crusoe,\" for he at least enjoyed the companionship of \"Friday,\" but Davis was all alone. Now and then a distant sail, like a tantalizing phantom, would come into view and fade away again from sight, being too far off to see his signals of distress. His only solace was the picture in a locket of her who was waiting, waiting, ever hopeful of his return; praying as, indeed, was he also, their prayers ascending at the same time to the Father Almighty, through whose Grace and Mercy they were both imbued with hope, for although she finds her lot arduous, the care of a child being an exacting responsibility, she has repeatedly rejected the suit of Tom Foster, a good fellow, who would care for her and her little one. But no, that intuition tells her John will return, although it seems at times she hopes in vain. However, John's prayers are at last answered, and a boat is sent from a passing ship to his rescue. Returning home unannounced, the sight that greets him freezes his blood, for there he sees his wife and Foster walking through the garden accompanied by the child. He at once concludes that he has been forgotten and his place taken by his friend. His soul is at first filled with revenge and he is about to strike Foster down, but no, she is happy. She thinks him dead, and why not let it be so? This would be the most kindly, so he slinks hack into the foliage, intending to go away forever. They pass into the house, leaving the little one playing on the lawn. He cannot resist folding the child his child to his heart.

Into her hands have fallen several theatrical newspapers, and she and her girl chum eagerly digest their contents, recounting in glowing terms what seems to be a golden existence. So wrought up were they that they immediately give vent to their ebullient spirits by indulging in a quasi-dramatic performance. This is a scene of broad burlesque, and, during its enaction, the minister enters and is greatly shocked, not to say incensed. A stormy scene occurs between him and his daughter, which ends with her leaving home. She applies for a position in the chorus of a New York opera company. What a contrast she makes at the trial of voices, but with determination she pulls through the ordeal and is accepted. Owing to her sweet face and manners, together with a beautiful voice, her rise in the profession is rapid. Still, she has found that all is not gold that glitters, and while her artistic success is most agreeable, life for her is empty, cold and cheerless, made more odious by the appearance of the inevitable vile, flattering tempter. Numerous letters has she written to her dear old father, but no response, for he has torn them into shreds before he even broke the seal. \"Oh, God, if I could only go back. If this all would prove but a dream.\" But, no, there is the dark fathomless future before her. The tempter would have her go with him, and there seems to be no alternative. She is now surely at the crossroads of life. She makes a final appeal to her father in a telegram begging him to come to see her performance on the night following, which he does. Down the aisle of the theater comes the old minister in bewilderment, so unaccustomed is he to the surroundings, as through the peekhole in the curtain drops the girl views the scene in ecstasy. After the performance the old man makes his way to the back of the stage, where he once more folds his daughter to his heart, while her would-be lover views the scene with unconcealed chagrin.

All was progressing serenely until the all-important question was put to Hezekiah, and instead of answering \"Yea,\" he kicked over the trace and tried to beat it.

Down from the terrace onto the road they leap and across the meadow until they come to a fence, on the other side of which are two boys shooting crap.

Owing to this mix-up Hez has a chance to distance them a little, and being almost exhausted, he attempts to climb a tree, but too late for the gang is soon upon him, and carry him back to the church where the ceremony is started again, and when he is asked that all-important question he fairly yells, \"Yes, b'gosh!\" Artemisia is now asked the question, and to the amazement of all present she says, \"Not on your county fair tintype,\" and flounces haughtily out of the church, leaving poor Hezekiah in a state of utter collapse, surrounded by sympathizing friends.", "A woman who is filled with romantic ideas is making no secret of her eagerness to find a husband.

The hills of Southern Spain were infested by a gang of lawless freebooters who terrorized the country and made travel in the mountains a hazardous pastime. They waylaid, robbed and often murdered the unwary tourist who chanced their way. In the opening of this Biograph picture a party of these Andalusian bushrangers, in command of their chieftain, are seen hiding behind a huge rock in waiting for prey. They haven't long to wait, for after having held up and relieved several pedestrians, a stylish landau approaches in which are seated an old gentleman, a duenna, and a pretty young Senora. The inevitable happens; all are relieved of their valuables, and while the gentleman and duenna are sent on their way, the girl is held a prisoner. She realizes her helplessness, and at the same time assumes that her beauty has made an impression on the chief, hence resorts to woman's wiles to captivate the bandit. In this she succeeds, but must use strategy to regain her jewels, which are still in his possession. Her subtle artifice is promising, when they are surprised by the police, who take them in hand, but the sergeant finding them possessed of so much wealth, is content to take that and let them go. From here they go to the mountain inn, where later the sergeant again puts in an appearance, so Senora bribes the waiting maid to allow her to act in that capacity, and as the sergeant does not recognize her, she having been veiled when they met in the road, he is lured to a private room, where he is overpowered, bound and gagged by the bandit, who regains the jewels, and with Senora flees to another hostelry. Here Senora piles her conquest with cajolery and wine until he falls into a drunken sleep. Now is her chance. She secures her jewelry and after leaving a derisive letter for the enamored bandit, departs to rejoin her friends, chuckling in anticipation of the chagrin of the pillager upon his awakening."], "votes": 17, "title": "The Bandit's Waterloo", "plot outline": "The Outwitting of an Andalusian Brigand by a Pretty Senora.

A knock at the door signals the entrance of the call-boy, with a note from the manager to say that she must come at once to the theater or suffer the loss of her position, a thing she can ill afford, as it furnishes the only revenue, meager as it is, with which she maintains her little home. Madly rushing to the theater, she hastens into her costume and appears at the entrance just as the curtain rises. Here is the crucial test of the actor's art. With heart as heavy as stone, she trips on to be greeted by the thousand smiling faces of pleasure-seekers in anxious anticipation of her dance, which is a feature of the performance. The dance over, she exits to be met by her mother, who has been sent by the doctor to bid her hurry home if she would see her loved one alive. Meanwhile there are storms of applause from an insistent public, soliciting an encore; hence she is aroused from her apparent lethargy by the stage manager, who fairly pushes her back on the stage. Again before the audience, her art befriends her, but in the course of the dance a mother's intuition asserts itself and in her mind's eye she sees her little one, but only for a moment, for the audience is thrown into a wild tumult, which tends to recall her to the exigencies of her position, and so she finishes the number. Dashing wildly from the theater to her home, she arrives, but too late. For when she meets the kind-hearted doctor at the door, her worst fears are confirmed. The scene that follows positively defies description, and we can only say that it is unquestionably the most powerful ever shown in motion pictures.", "A mother works as a dancer to support her ill daughter.

Miss Vane is playing in wretched luck, and is advised several times by Mrs. Wharton to desist, but she still plays on in the vain hopes of the tide of fortune turning, until at last, in the extreme of desperation, she stakes her all and loses. Shame and disgrace stare her in the face. What can she do to recoup her depleted fortune? As one of the guests there is Professor Francois Paracelsus, the eminent palmister, who of course, was called upon to read the palms of those present. Sheets of paper were prepared and each imprinted their hand on a sheet to be read by the erudite soothsayer at his leisure, and so were left on the drawing room table. All have now retired to the apartments assigned them by Mrs. Wharton, but there seems to be a sleepless night before Myrtle, and she suffers mental agony, until the thought of the necklace flashes before her mind's eye. 0, if she only possessed those treasures all would be well. The more she thought of it the more unconquerable became her covetousness, until the inimitable determination to secure them seized her, but how? To enter her room by the door would not only arouse the hostess, but maybe the guests as well. There was but one way, by the window, and this undertaking was decidedly hazardous, for it meant that she must crawl along the narrow ledge between her window and that of Mrs. Wharton, a distance of twenty feet, and one slight misstep would result in her being dashed to death on the walk below. But when a woman will, so she makes the trip without mishap, entering the room she searches noiselessly for the top of the dresser, finds it, secures the necklace, and makes her way back to her apartment. Now to hide the jewels. An ingenious idea strikes her. She cuts in two a bar of soap, and hollowing it out, places the treasure inside and joins the parts together. Meanwhile Mrs. Wharton, aroused from her slumber, intuitively looks to her diamonds, but finds them gone. \"What's this? A clue!\" On the dresser there is a sheet of the palmister's paper on which there is a handprint of dust. Down to the drawing room for the corresponding imprint. There it is, and signed \"Myrtle Vane.\" To Miss Vane's room goes the furious Mrs. Wharton, and during the scene that transpires the soap is brushed from the table and breaks open, exposing the necklace, at the same time convicting the poor girl. Upon the recovery of her jewels, Mrs. Wharton's anger subsides and she is inclined to be charitable towards the unfortunate girl kneeling at her feet, so she not only forgives her, but insists upon aiding her financially."], "votes": 63, "title": "Betrayed by a Handprint", "plot outline": "Mrs. Wharton, a dashing widow, gives a party at her beautiful villa in honor of the presentation to her of a handsome diamond necklace by her fianc\u00e9...", "kind": "movie", "aspect ratio": "1.33 : 1", "languages": ["English"], "cast": ["Florence Lawrence", "Harry Solter", "Linda Arvidson", "Kate Bruce", "Gene Gauntier", "George Gebhardt", "Mack Sennett"], "countries": ["USA"], "country codes": ["us"], "language codes": ["en"], "cover url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg3MTI3ODI2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg1MDA4Mg@@._V1._CR64,90,235,329._SX100_SY140_.jpg"}
